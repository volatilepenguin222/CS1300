        <h4>Interface: Automatic Gas Stove</h4>
        <div class="intro">
          Since a lot of people come to my apartment to cook and people often
          cook with or for other people, I figured that an automatic gas stove
          was a reasonable public interface to highlight.

            This interface is meant to enable users to cook food in a more
            controlled way, as opposed to the more historic form of an open
            fire. An automatic gas stovetop, as opposed to a manual gas
            stovetop, allows for a simpler start by making the lighting feature
            of the gas emitted inherent to the stove itself (for manual, a
            person would need to set the gas aflame with another external
            device, such as a match, or lighter). This enables modern-day
            cooking to be both safer and more efficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            The automatic gas stovetop interface relies heavily on knobs for
            control. Each knob dictates the fire-starting and heat strength for
            a single burner. The top of each knob has a black line indicating
            where the knob is currently pointing - the starting position is
            labeled 'Off', and moving counter-clockwise, each is labeled for the
            'Light' setting, followed by the flame setting from 'High' to 'Low'.
            Spatially, the knobs are aligned with their respective burners in
            order to be as intuitive as possible for the user. Additionally,
            each knob is annotated with a simplified graphic of the stovetop,
            indicating which burner it is for by highlighting the respective
            burner in black. To use a burner, a user should press down on a knob
            and turn it to 'Light'; this results in an electric sparker setting
            the gas ablaze. After a few seconds to ensure lighting has occurred,
            the user can then turn the knob to their desired flame setting. Both
            front burners feature an extra-strength burner, labeled as such
            under their respective knobs. The high grate height relative to the
            burners allows for free flow of gas such that a flame can
            successfully light and enables a more even distribution of heat.
            Additionally, using grates allows users to be able to actually see
            of the strength of the flame, something which more visually-prone
            people find helpful.

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <div class="grid">

          <h2>Key Observations</h2>
          The task given was to cook a frozen strawberry waffle using the
          automatic gas stove. Majority of users began by eyeing the knob
          interface and audibly questioning, "Now how do I do this?". Most users
          didn't notice the griddle burner option and opted for using a pan over
          the front left burner (Neither did any of them consider the 'POWER
          BOIL' annotation). One user did not know how to use the knobs; gas was
          left to emit ~20 seconds before they turned the knob somewhere close
          to the 'Light' position. Once a flame had lit, they left the knob in
          between the 'Light' position and the 'High' position, such that the
          the sparker continued to run, as indicated by a 'flick flick' sound
          that kept repeating; however, they maintained their confidence
          throughout the task. All users began with the flame at its highest
          setting, and some users lowered it when they thought the waffle was
          cooking unevenly. All users were very attentive to the item they were
          cooking and also attempted to seek external assurance that the object
          was done cooking.

              really likes the stove, knobs seem kind of outdated if anything

              Additionally, at first I wasn't sure which direction to turn the

              direction the labels were going.

            contemplating life but accepts the hard-work lifestyle. Today was a
            busy day - she just wants to munch on a warm, sweet snack and knock

            stopping by the grocery store to grab a salad but instead
            impulse-buys a stovetop skillet cookie kit.
